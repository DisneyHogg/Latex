\section{Introduction}
These will be a set of notes dedicated to a project looking at the affine toda lattice, but in situ we will cover some theory from Lie algebras and representations. See my notes on Kac-Moody algebras and Symmetries, Fields, and Particles for additional background which I will omit here as it is covered there.
