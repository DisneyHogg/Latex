The following set of files are notes and documents I have worked on during my time of my PhD, and earlier.
My hope is to extend the use of the Notes directory to allow people who read my notes to suggest updates.
There is no personal data which needs protecting, so you are free to read at your own leisure. 
I use texlive as my compiler (currently using the 2017 repository). This I edit with texstudio currently. 

The current architecture is as such:

header.sty
This is my big header file that I use in almost all my Latex documents. 
It has a modification (header-colourful) which adds some (what I think are pretty) colours to the notes.  

bib/
This is a directory containing my bibliography jabref_library.bib (created using Jabref). A custom bibliography style I created using makebst (http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/custom-bib/makebst.pdf) (obviously named as custom-bib-style.bst) is also included. 

'Example sheets and assignments'/
This is work I have typed up for any courses. I do not particularly use it often.
I did not get 100% for these assignments, so don't trust that the answers are 100% correct.  

Notes/ 
Notes I have written on a bunch of topics. 
The notes are not guaranteed to be correct, and any comments are welcomed.
Moreover, there is scope for concolidation within notes, which should happen eventually. 

Teaching/
Documents I have written to aid with teaching or presentations
