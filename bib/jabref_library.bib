  abstract      = {The study of higher-dimensional black holes is a subject which has recently attracted a vast interest. Perhaps one of the most surprising discoveries is a realization that the properties of higher-dimensional black holes with the spherical horizon topology and described by the Kerr-NUT-(A)dS metrics are very similar to the properties of the well known four-dimensional Kerr metric. This remarkable result stems from the existence of a single object called the principal tensor. In our review we discuss explicit and hidden symmetries of higher-dimensional black holes. We start with the overview of the Liouville theory of completely integrable systems and introduce Killing and Killing-Yano objects representing explicit and hidden symmetries. We demonstrate that the principal tensor can be used as a `seed object' which generates all these symmetries. It determines the form of the black hole geometry, as well as guarantees its remarkable properties, such as special algebraic type of the spacetime, complete integrability of geodesic motion, and separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi, Klein-Gordon, and Dirac equations. The review also contains a discussion of different applications of the developed formalism and its possible generalizations.},

Such a spacetime admits a Bargmann structure and corresponds physically to a plane-fronted gravitational wave (generalized pp wave). Bargmann electromagnetism in five dimensions actually comprises the two distinct Galilean electromagnetic theories pointed out by Le Bellac and L{\'{e}}vy-Leblond. At the quantum level, the N-body Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation may be cast into the form of a massless wave equation. We exploit the conformal symmetries of such spacetimes to discuss some properties of the Newtonian N-body problem, in particular, (i) homographic solutions, (ii) the virial theorem, (iii) Kepler's third law, (iv) the Lagrange-Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector arising from three conformal Killing two-tensors, and (v) the motion under time-dependent inverse-square-law forces whose strength varies inversely as time in a manner originally envisaged by Dirac in his theory of a time-dependent gravitational constant G(t). It is found that the problem can be reduced to one with time-independent inverse-square-law forces for a rescaled position vector and a new time variable. This transformation (Vinti and Lynden-Bell) is shown to arise from a particular conformal transformation of spacetime which preserves the Ricci-flat condition originally pointed out by Brinkmann. We also point out (vi) a Ricci-flat metric representing a system of N nonrelativistic gravitational dyons. Our results for a general time-dependent G(t) are also applicable by suitable reinterpretation to the motion of point particles in an expanding universe. Finally we extend these results to the quantum regime. {\textcopyright} 1991 The American Physical Society.},

The matching and impedance levels can be chosen individually for both passbands.

The remaining case includes the situation when the ends facing each other have a power law tail while the two extreme ends of the two kinks have an exponential tail. Further, we show that for a kink with a power law tail at either one end or at both ends, there is no gap between the zero mode and the continuum of the corresponding stability equation. This is in contrast with the kinks with an exponential tail at both ends, in which case there is always a gap between the zero mode and the continuum.},

  abstract = {Background: An inverse relationship between allergies with glioma risk has been reported in several but not all epidemiological observational studies. We performed an analysis of genetic variants associated with atopy to assess the relationship with glioma risk using Mendelian randomisation (MR), an approach unaffected by biases from temporal variability and reverse causation that might have affected earlier investigations. Methods: Two-sample MR was undertaken using genome-wide association study data. We used single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with atopic dermatitis, asthma and hay fever, IgE levels, and self-reported allergy as instrumental variables. We calculated MR estimates for the odds ratio (OR) for each risk factor with glioma using SNP-glioma estimates from 12,488 cases and 18,169 controls, using inverse-variance weighting (IVW), maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), weighted median estimate (WME) and mode-based estimate (MBE) methods. Violation of MR assumptions due to directional pleiotropy were sought using MR-Egger regression and HEIDI-outlier analysis. Results: Under IVW, MLE, WME and MBE methods, associations between glioma risk with asthma and hay fever, self-reported allergy and IgE levels were non-significant. An inverse relationship between atopic dermatitis and glioma risk was found by IVW (OR 0.96, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 0.93-1.00, P = 0.041) and MLE (OR 0.96, 95{\%} CI 0.94-0.99, P = 0.003), but not by WME (OR 0.96, 95{\%} CI 0.91-1.01, P = 0.114) or MBE (OR 0.97, 95{\%} CI 0.92-1.02, P = 0.194). Conclusions: Our investigation does not provide strong evidence for relationship between atopy and the risk of developing glioma, but findings do not preclude a small effect in relation to atopic dermatitis. Our analysis also serves to illustrate the value of using several MR methods to derive robust conclusions.},

  abstract  = {Introducing the reader to classical integrable systems and their applications, this book synthesizes the different approaches to the subject, providing a set of interconnected methods for solving problems in mathematical physics. The authors introduce and explain each method, and demonstrate how it can be applied to particular examples. Rather than presenting an exhaustive list of the various integrable systems, they focus on classical objects which have well-known quantum counterparts, or are the semi-classical limits of quantum objects. They thus enable readers to understand the literature on quantum integrable systems. This book provides a thorough introduction to the theory of classical integrable systems, discussing the various approaches to the subject and explaining their interrelations. The book begins by introducing the central ideas of the theory of integrable systems, based on Lax representations, loop groups and Riemann surfaces. These ideas are then illustrated with detailed studies of model systems. The connection between isomonodromic deformation and integrability is discussed, and integrable field theories are covered in detail. The KP, KdV and Toda hierarchies are explained using the notion of Grassmannian, vertex operators and pseudo-differential operators. A chapter is devoted to the inverse scattering method and three complementary chapters cover the necessary mathematical tools from symplectic geometry, Riemann surfaces and Lie algebras. The book contains many worked examples and is suitable for use as a textbook on graduate courses. It also provides a comprehensive reference for researchers already working in the field.},

  abstract = {Background: Obesity and related factors have been implicated as possible aetiological factors for the development of glioma in epidemiological observation studies. We used genetic markers in a Mendelian randomisation framework to examine whether obesity-related traits influence glioma risk. This methodology reduces bias from confounding and is not affected by reverse causation. Methods: Genetic instruments were identified for 10 key obesity-related risk factors, and their association with glioma risk was evaluated using data from a genome-wide association study of 12,488 glioma patients and 18,169 controls. The estimated odds ratio of glioma associated with each of the genetically defined obesity-related traits was used to infer evidence for a causal relationship. Results: No convincing association with glioma risk was seen for genetic instruments for body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, lipids, type-2 diabetes, hyperglycaemia or insulin resistance. Similarly, we found no evidence to support a relationship between obesity-related traits with subtypes of glioma-glioblastoma (GBM) or non-GBM tumours. Conclusions: This study provides no evidence to implicate obesity-related factors as causes of glioma.},

We will first develop the general theory of explicit and hidden symmetries for particles and fields, and relate them to conserved quantities and integrability of physical theories. The most general spacetime allowing the principal conformal Killing-Yano tensor is constructed, and we derive a suitable coordinate basis for this canonical metric. This we identify with the Kerr-NUT-(A)dS metric upon imposing the Einstein field equations, which describes a very general class of spacetimes with black holes with spherical topology of the event horizon. Focus is then turned onto those higher dimensional stationary black holes, which can all be considered special cases of the Kerr-NUT-(A)dS metric. This treatment includes especially the Kerr, Schwarzschild-Tangherlini and Myers-Perry black holes.},

  abstract  = {A fundamental problem in the theory of Hopf algebras is the classification and construction of finite-dimensional quasitriangular Hopf algebras over C. Quasitriangular Hopf algebras constitute a very important class of Hopf algebras, introduced by Drinfeld. They are the Hopf algebras whose representations form a braided tensor category. However, this intriguing problem is extremely hard and is still widely open. Triangular Hopf algebras are the quasitriangular Hopf algebras whose representations form a symmetric tensor category. In that sense they are the closest to group algebras. The structure of triangular Hopf algebras is far from trivial , and yet is more tractable than that of general Hopf algebras, due to their proximity to groups. This makes triangular Hopf algebras an excellent testing ground for general Hopf algebraic ideas, methods and conjectures. A general classification of triangular Hopf algebras is not known yet. However, the problem was solved in the semisimple case, in the minimal triangular pointed case, and more generally for triangular Hopf algebras with the Chevalley property. In this paper we report on all of this, and explain in full details the mathematics and ideas involved in this theory. The classification in the semisimple case relies on Deligne's theorem on Tannakian categories and on Movshev's theory in an essential way. We explain Movshev's theory in details, and refer to [G5] for a detailed discussion of the first aspect. We also discuss the existence of grouplike elements in quasitriangular semisimple Hopf algebras, and the representation theory of cotriangular semisimple Hopf algebras. We conclude the paper with a list of open problems; in particular with the question whether any finite-dimensional triangular Hopf algebra over C has the Chevalley property.},

  abstract = {Little is known about the causes of meningioma. Obesity and obesity-related traits have been reported in several epidemiological observational studies to be risk factors for meningioma. We performed an analysis of genetic variants associated with obesity-related traits to assess the relationship with meningioma risk using Mendelian randomization (MR), an approach unaffected by biases from temporal variability and reverse causation that might have affected earlier investigations. We considered 11 obesity-related traits, identified genetic instruments for these factors, and assessed their association with meningioma risk using data from a genome-wide association study comprising 1,606 meningioma patients and 9,823 controls. To evaluate the causal relationship between the obesity-related traits and meningioma risk, we consider the estimated odds ratio (OR) of meningioma for each genetic instrument. We identified positive associations between body mass index (odds ratio [OR SD ] = 1.27, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 1.03–1.56, P = 0.028) and body fat percentage (OR SD = 1.28, 95{\%} CI = 1.01–1.63, P = 0.042) with meningioma risk, albeit non-significant after correction for multiple testing. Associations for basal metabolic rate, diastolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, triglycerides and waist circumference with risk of meningioma were non-significant. Our analysis provides additional support for obesity being associated with an increased risk of meningioma.},

More recently,$\backslash$nthe calculus of variations has found applications in other fields$\backslash$nsuch as economics and electrical engineering. Much of the mathematics$\backslash$nunderlying control theory, for instance, can be regarded as part$\backslash$nof the calculus of variations.This book is an introductory account$\backslash$nof the calculus of variations suitable for advanced undergraduate$\backslash$nand graduate students of mathematics, physics, or engineering. The$\backslash$nmathematical background assumed of the reader is a course in multivariable$\backslash$ncalculus, and some familiarity with the elements of real analysis$\backslash$nand ordinary differential equations. The book focuses on variational$\backslash$nproblems that involve one independent variable. The fixed endpoint$\backslash$nproblem and problems with constraints are discussed in detail. In$\backslash$naddition, more advanced topics such as the inverse problem, eigenvalue$\backslash$nproblems, separability conditions for the Hamilton-Jacobi equation,$\backslash$nand Noether's theorem are discussed. The text contains numerous examples$\backslash$nto illustrate key concepts along with problems to help the student$\backslash$nconsolidate the material. The book can be used as a textbook for$\backslash$na one semester course on the calculus of variations, or as a book$\backslash$nto supplement a course on applied mathematics or classical mechanics.$\backslash$nBruce van Brunt is Senior Lecturer at Massey University, New Zealand.$\backslash$nHe is the author of The Lebesgue-Stieltjes Integral, with Michael$\backslash$nCarter, and has been teaching the calculus of variations to undergraduate$\backslash$nand graduate students for several years.},

It is robust to perturbations of input data, independent of dimensions and coordinates, and provides a compact representation of the qualitative features of the input. The computation of PH is an open area with numerous important and fascinating challenges. The field of PH computation is evolving rapidly, and new algorithms and software implementations are being updated and released at a rapid pace. The purposes of our article are to (1) introduce theory and computational methods for PH to a broad range of computational scientists and (2) provide benchmarks of state-of-the-art implementations for the computation of PH. We give a friendly introduction to PH, navigate the pipeline for the computation of PH with an eye towards applications, and use a range of synthetic and real-world data sets to evaluate currently available open-source implementations for the computation of PH. Based on our benchmarking, we indicate which algorithms and implementations are best suited to different types of data sets. In an accompanying tutorial, we provide guidelines for the computation of PH. We make publicly available all scripts that we wrote for the tutorial, and we make available the processed version of the data sets used in the benchmarking.},

We show how to “learn” the homology of the submanifold with high confidence. We discuss an algorithm to do this and provide learning-theoretic complexity bounds. Our bounds are obtained in terms of a condition number that limits the curvature and nearness to self-intersection of the submanifold. We are also able to treat the situation where the data are “noisy” and lie near rather than on the submanifold in question.},

  abstract = {Persistence homology is a vital tool for topological data analysis. Previous work has developed some statistical estimators for characteristics of collections of persistence diagrams. However, tools that provide statistical inference for observations that are persistence diagrams are limited. Specifically, there is a need for tests that can assess the strength of evidence against a claim that two samples arise from the same population or process. This expository paper provides an introduction to randomization-style null hypothesis significance tests (NHST) and shows how they can be used with sets of persistence diagrams. The hypothesis test is based on a loss function that comprises pairwise distances between the elements of each sample and all the elements in the other sample. We use this method to analyze a range of simulated and experimental data. Through these examples we experimentally explore the power of the p-values. Our results show that the randomization-style NHST based on pairwise distances can distinguish between samples from different processes, which suggests that its use for hypothesis tests upon persistence diagrams is reasonable. We demonstrate its application on a real dataset of fMRI data of patients with ADHD.},

Therefore from the point of view of these requirements the coordinate x is in no way worse than the coordinate q. Only the requirement that the position operator must be hermitian is crucial for rejecting the x-coordinate.},

  year      = {1988},
  abstract  = {Systems governed by non-linear differential equations are of fundamental importance in all branches of science, but our understanding of them is still extremely limited. In this book a particular system, describing the interaction of magnetic monopoles, is investigated in detail. The use of new geometrical methods produces a reasonably clear picture of the dynamics for slowly moving monopoles. This picture clarifies the important notion of solitons, which has attracted much attention in recent years. The soliton idea bridges the gap between the concepts of "fields" and "particles," and is here explored in a fully three-dimensional context. While the background and motivation for the work comes from physics, the presentation is mathematical.  This book is interdisciplinary and addresses concerns of theoretical physicists interested in elementary particles or general relativity and mathematicians working in analysis or geometry. The interaction between geometry and physics through non-linear partial differential equations is now at a very exciting stage, and the book is a contribution to this activity.  Originally published in 1988.  ThePrinceton Legacy Libraryuses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

The analysis is largely in terms of the spectral curves, the rational maps, and the Nahm equations associated with monopoles. We consider monopoles invariant under inversion in a plane, monopoles with cyclic symmetry, and monopoles having the symmetry of a regular solid. We introduce the notion of a strongly centred monopole and show that the space of such monopoles is a geodesic submanifold of the monopole moduli space. By solving Nahm's equations we prove the existence of a tetrahedrally symmetric monopole of charge 3 and an octahedrally symmetric monopole of charge 4, and determine their spectral curves. Using the geodesic approximation to analyse the scattering of monopoles with cyclic symmetry, we discover a novel type of non-planar k-monopole scattering process.},

  abstract = {A polynomial time algorithm is presented for the founding question of Galois theory: determining solvability by radicals of a monic irreducible polynomial over the integers. Also a polynomial time algorithm which expresses a root in radicals in terms of a straightline program is given. Polynomial time algorithms are demonstrated for computing blocks of imprimitivity of roots of the polynomial under the action of the Galois group, and for computing intersections of algebraic number fields. In all of the algorithms it is assumed that the number field is given by a primitive element which generates it over the rationals, that the polynomial in question is monic, and that its coefficients are in the integers.},

The same method is then used to construct, among others, the octad graph, the Witt design and the Golay code. This book also provides a systematic account of 'small groups', and serves as a useful reference for the Mathieu groups.

  abstract  = {The study of vector bundles over algebraic varieties has been stimulated over the last few years by successive waves of migrant concepts, largely from mathematical physics, whilst retaining its roots in old questions concerning subvarieties of projective space. The 1993 Durham Symposium on Vector Bundles in Algebraic Geometry brought together some of the leading researchers in the field to explore further these interactions. This book is a collection of survey articles by the main speakers at the symposium and presents to the mathematical world an overview of the key areas of research involving vector bundles. Topics covered include those linking gauge theory and geometric invariant theory such as augmented bundles and coherent systems; Donaldson invariants of algebraic surfaces; Floer homology and quantum cohomology; conformal field theory and the moduli spaces of bundles on curves; the Horrocks-Mumford bundle and codimension 2 subvarieties in P4 and P5; exceptional bundles and stable sheaves on projective space.},

The curve C is called bielliptic if it admits a degree-two morphism π : C → E onto an elliptic curve E such a morphism is called a bielliptic structure on C. If C is bielliptic and g≥6, then the bielliptic structure on C is unique, but if g=3,4,5, then this holds true only generically and there are curves carrying n≫1 bielliptic structures. The sharp bounds n ≤ 21,10,5 exist for g=3,4,5 respectively. Let Mg be the coarse moduli space of irreducible, smooth, projective curves of genus g=3,4,5. Denote by Bng the locus of points in Mg $ representing curves carrying at least n bielliptic structures. It is then natural to ask the following questions. Clearly Bgn⊆Bgn-1 does Bgn≠Bgn-1 hold? What are the irreducible components of Bng? Are the irreducible components of Bng rational? How do the irreducible components of Bng intersect each other? Let C∈Bg2 how many non-isomorphic elliptic quotients can it have? Complete answers are given to the above questions in the case g=4.},

We derive some basic properties of (p, n)-gonal surfaces considered as generalizations of hyperelliptic surfaces and also examine certain properties which do not generalize. In particular, we find a condition which guarantees all (p, n)-gonal groups are conjugate in the full automorphism group of a (p, n)-gonal surface, and we find an upper bound for the size of the corresponding conjugacy class. Furthermore we give an upper bound for the number of conjugacy classes of (p, n)-gonal groups of a (p, n)-gonal surface in the general case. We finish by analyzing certain properties of quasiplatonic (p, n)-gonal surfaces. An open problem and two conjectures are formulated in the paper.},

  abstract  = {Two classical results in algebraic geometry are that the branch curve of a del Pezzo surface of degree 1 can be embedded as a space sextic curve in P3 and that every space sextic curve has exactly 120 tritangents corresponding to its odd theta characteristics. In this paper we revisit both results from the computational perspective. Specifically, we give an algorithm to construct space sextic curves that arise from blowing up P2 at eight points and provide algorithms to compute the 120 tritangents and their Steiner system of any space sextic. Furthermore, we develop efficient inverses to the aforementioned methods. We present an algorithm to either reconstruct the original eight points in P2 from a space sextic or certify that this is not possible. Moreover, we extend a construction of Lehavi [8] which recovers a space sextic from its tritangents and Steiner system. All algorithms in this paper have been implemented in magma.},

Hirzebruch [9] showed that the smooth model Y 2 of the Hilbert modular surface of level 2 for the field Q ([special characters omitted]) is isomorphic to the Klein surface of the icosahedron obtained from a blowing-up of [special characters omitted]. Later, T. Schmidt [16] showed that under this isomorphism, the Cohen-Wolfart embedding of the non-arithmetic Hecke group of signature (2, 5, ∞) has a lift in Y2 that corresponds to six specific exceptional divisors of the Klein surface.    In this dissertation, we consider the Klein A5 -Invariants of [special characters omitted] as seen in the Klein surface. We show, using Hirzebruch's isomorphism, that their images in the Hilbert modular surface X of level one are curves uniformized by non-compact and non-arithmetic triangle groups contained in the Hilbert modular group. We also give a correspondence between the A5-orbits of [special characters omitted] and the elliptic singularities of the surface  X.},

The goal of this paper is to give a description of the moduli space of (1, 5)?polarized abelian surfaces (without level structure) up to duality. We prove that an open set of this moduli space is isomorphic to an open set of the moduli space of sextuplets of points on a complex projective line (up to homographies) and we study what happens on the boundary.},

Earlier authors have only treated the case of elliptic curves defined over the real numbers; here, the multi-valued nature of the complex AGM plays an important role. Our method, which we have implemented in both MAGMA and Sage, is illustrated with several examples using elliptic curves defined over number fields with real and complex embeddings.},

New light has been shed, for instance, on the famous conjectures of Tate and Shafarevich relating to abelian varieties and the associated celebrated discoveries of Faltings establishing the Mordell conjecture. This book gives an account of the theory of linear forms in the logarithms of algebraic numbers with special emphasis on the important developments of the past twenty-five years. The first part covers basic material in transcendental number theory but with a modern perspective. The remainder assumes some background in Lie algebras and group varieties, and covers, in some instances for the first time in book form, several advanced topics. The final chapter summarises other aspects of Diophantine geometry including hypergeometric theory and the André-Oort conjecture. A comprehensive bibliography rounds off this definitive survey of effective methods in Diophantine geometry.},

This book provides new insights into this subject; much of the material here is entirely new, and none has appeared in book form before. Included is an explicit treatment of the Jacobian, which throws new light onto the geometry of the Kummer surface. The Mordell-Weil group can then be determined for many curves, and in many non-trivial cases all rational points can be found. The results exemplify the power of computer algebra in diophantine contexts, but computer expertise is not assumed in the main text. Number theorists, algebraic geometers and workers in related areas will find that this book offers unique insights into the arithmetic of curves of genus 2.},

Numerical results in an earlier paper suggest that one of these new monopoles, the tetrahedral 3-monopole, has a remarkable new property, in that the number of zeros of the Higgs field is greater than the topological charge (number of monopoles). As a consequence, zeros of the Higgs field exist (called anti-zeros) around which the local winding number has opposite sign to that of the total winding. In this letter we investigate the presence of anti-zeros for the other Platonic monopoles. Other aspects of anti-zeros are also discussed.},

The cost has been that much of the research of previous generations is in a language unintelligible to modern workers, in particular, the rich legacy of classical algebraic geometry, such as plane algebraic curves of low degree, special algebraic surfaces, theta functions, Cremona transformations, the theory of apolarity and the geometry of lines in projective spaces. The author's contemporary approach makes this legacy accessible to modern algebraic geometers and to others who are interested in applying classical results. The vast bibliography of over 600 references is complemented by an array of exercises that extend or exemplify results given in the book.},

  abstract = {We show that the complete planar S-matrix of $ \mathcal{N} = 4 $super Yang-Mills -- including all NkMHV partial amplitudes to all loops -- is equivalent to the correlation function of a supersymmetric Wilson loop in twistor space. Remarkably, the entire classical S-matrix arises from evaluating the correlation function in the self-dual sector, while the expansion of the correlation function in powers of the Yang-Mills coupling constant provides the loop expansion of the amplitudes. We support our proposal with explicit computations of the n particle NMHV and N2MHV trees, the integrands of the 1-loop MHV and NMHV amplitudes, and the n particle 2-loop MHV amplitude. These calculations are performed using the twistor action in axial gauge. In this gauge, the Feynman diagrams of the correlation function are the planar duals of the usual MHV diagrams for the scattering amplitude. The results are presented in the form of a sum of products of dual superconformal invariants in (momentum) twistor space, and agree with the expressions derived in the companion paper [1] directly from the MHV rules. The twistor space Wilson loop is a natural supersymmetric generalization of the standard Wilson loop used to compute MHV amplitudes. We show how the Penrose-Ward transform can be used to determine a corresponding supersymmetrization on space-time and give the corresponding superconnection in the abelian case.},

In particular the mass formula for BPS states is given by the periods of a special differential on Σn. In this note we point out that the surface Σn can be obtained from the quotient of a symmetric n-monopole spectral curve by its symmetry group. Known results about the Seiberg-Witten curves then imply that these monopoles are related to the An−1(1) Toda lattice. We make this relation explicit via the ADHMN construction. Furthermore, in the simplest case, that of two SU(2) monopoles, we find that the general two monopole solution is generated by an affine Toda soliton solution of the imaginary coupled theory.},

  abstract = {A famous theorem of Donaldson describes a correspondence between SU(2) monopoles over three-dimensional Euclidean space and maps from CP1 to itself. This paper generalises this to monopoles with arbitrary gauge group G, and new maps from CP1 to flag manifolds G/H are produced. This is in line with a conjecture of Atiyah and Murray, following a similar result of Atiyah's on hyperbolic monopoles.Donaldson's approach, also followed by Hurtubise and Murray in previous proofs of many important cases of the current result, depends on a description of monopoles in terms of a system of ordinary differential equations known as Nahm's equations. In contrast, our approach is more direct, and the bulk of the paper is concerned with describing the rational map associated to a particular framed monopole, via solutions to a scattering equation (first introduced by Hitchin) along parallel lines.A subsidiary section of the paper analyses rational maps into flag manifolds, constructing canonical lifts into larger flag manifolds, and into the (complexified) Lie group. The main result is dependent upon additional work in a companion paper, ‘Construction of Euclidean monopoles’, to appear in the same journal, where a procedure is described for recovering a monopole from its rational map. 1991 Mathematics Subject Classification: 53C80, 58D27, 58E15, 58G11.},

In the moduli space approximation these geodesics describe a novel kind of monopole scattering. During these scattering processes axial symmetry is instantaneously attained and, in some, monopoles with the symmetries of the regular solids are formed. The simplest example corresponds to a charge three monopole invariant under a combined inversion and 90° rotation symmetry. In this example three well-separated collinear unit charge monopoles coalesce to form first a tetrahedron, then a torus, then the dual tetrahedron and finally separate again along the same axis of motion. We explicitly construct the spectral curves in this case and use a numerical ADHMN construction to compute the energy density at various times during the motion. We find that the dynamics of the zeros of the Higgs field is extremely rich and we discover a new phenomenon; there exist charge k SU(2) BPS monopoles with more than k zeros of the Higgs field.},

Previous work has established a countable family of solutions to Hitchin’s constraint that L2 was trivial on such a curve. Here we establish that the only curves of this family that yield BPS monopoles correspond to tetrahedrally symmetric monopoles. We introduce several new techniques making use of a factorization theorem of Fay and Accola for theta functions, together with properties of the Humbert variety. The geometry leads us to a formulation purely in terms of elliptic functions. A more general conjecture than needed for the stated result is given.},

  abstract  = {Elliptic functions and Riemann surfaces played an important role in nineteenth-century mathematics. At the present time there is a great revival of interest in these topics not only for their own sake but also because of their applications to so many areas of mathematical research from group theory and number theory to topology and differential equations. In this book the authors give elementary accounts of many aspects of classical complex function theory including Möbius transformations, elliptic functions, Riemann surfaces, Fuchsian groups and modular functions. A distinctive feature of their presentation is the way in which they have incorporated into the text many interesting topics from other branches of mathematics. This book is based on lectures given to advanced undergraduates and is well-suited as a textbook for a second course in complex function theory. Professionals will also find it valuable as a straightforward introduction to a subject which is finding widespread application throughout mathematics.},

Most of the theories admit reduction, in which the equation is satisfied by fewer than r fields. The reductions in the existing literature are achieved by identifying (folding) the points in the Dynkin diagrams which are connected by symmetry (automorphism). In this paper we present many new reductions. In other words, the symmetry of affine Dynkin diagrams could be extended and it leads to non-canonical foldings. We investigate these reduction in detail and formulate general rules for possible reductions. We will show that eventually most of the theories end up in a(2)2n that is the theory cannot have a further dimension m reduction where m &lt; n.},

In Section 2 we prove the simplest case of a conjecture of Kruskal and Zabusky concerning the existence of double wave solutions of the Korteweg-de Vries equation, i.e., of solutions which for |I| large behave as the superposition of two solitary waves travelling at different speeds.

  abstract = {The geodesic approximation is a powerful method for studying the dynamics of BPS solitons. However, there are systems, such as BPS monopoles in three-dimensional hyperbolic space, where this approach is not applicable because the moduli space metric defined by the kinetic energy is not finite. In the case of hyperbolic monopoles, an alternative metric has been defined using the abelian connection on the sphere at infinity, but its relation to the dynamics of hyperbolic monopoles is unclear. Here this metric is placed in a more general context of boundary metrics on soliton moduli spaces. Examples are studied in systems in one and two space dimensions, where it is much easier to compare the results with simulations of the full nonlinear field theory dynamics. It is found that geodesics of the boundary metric provide a reasonable description of soliton dynamics.},

The bound is attained for Klein's quarticof genus 3 [4]. In studying the problem whether there are any other curves for which the bound is attained, I was led to consider the universal covering space of the Riemann surface, which, as Siegel observed, relates Hurwitz's theorem to Siegel's own result [7] on the measure of the fundamental region of Fuchsian groups. Any curve with 84(g − 1) automorphisms must be uniformized by a normal subgroup of the triangle group (2, 3, 7), and, by a closer analysis of possible finite factor groups of (2, 3, 7), purely algebraic methods yield an infinite family of curves with the maximum number of automorphisms. This will be shown in a later paper.},

We compare the classical solitonic differential cross section to the low-energy quantum BPS SU(2) magnetic monopole differential cross section obtained by Schroers. Our numerical experiments suggest that the classical solitonic BPS magnetic monopole differential cross section approximates well the quantum BPS magnetic monopole differential cross section. In particular, the expected quantum interference of identical bosons at scattering angle θ = π2 (centre-of-mass frame) is not observed numerically, and indeed is contradicted. We argue that the lack of singularities in the two-body configuration space, related to the solitonic qualities of the BPS SU(2) magnetic monopole, is responsible for the agreement observed between the classical solitonic and the quantum mechanical cross sections. We also study the scattering and bounded classical motions of BPS SU(2) dyons and their global structure in phase space by constructing “escape plots”. The escape plots contain a surprising amount of structure. The escape plots suggest that the classical dynamics of two BPS SU(2) magnetic monopoles is non-integrable and that there are closed and bounded two-monopole motions with isolated energies.},

S is isomorphic to the symmetric group of degree 5 and Wiman emphasizes that S does permute among themselves 5 pencils (4 pencils of lines and 1 of conics) and 5 nets (4 nets of conics and 1 of lines). But he gives no geometrical properties of W. The omission should be repaired because, as will be explained below, W can be uniquely determined by elementary geometrical conditions. Furthermore: W is only one, though admittedly the most interesting, of a whole pencil P of 4-nodal sextics; every member of P is invariant under S+, the icosahedral subgroup of index 2 in S, while the transformations in the coset S/S+ transpose the members of P in pairs save for two that they leave fixed, W being one of these. When the triangle of reference is the diagonal point triangle of the quadrangle of its nodes the form of W is (7.2) below. Wiman referred his curve to a different triangle.},

We discuss the cyclic covers of any curve of genus 7, the local structure of the moduli space at the corresponding Weierstrass points for each curve. We show that the largest finite group acting as the full automorphism group of a hyperelliptic curve of genus 7 has order 64 and we find its equation. We then obtain all the 3g − 3 = 18 hyperelliptic curves of genus 7 and their full automorphism groups.

From these special polygons, we obtain geometric information for the action: a basis for the homology group of surfaces, its intersection matrix, and the action of the given generators of G on this basis. We then use the Frobenius algorithm to obtain a symplectic representation G of G corresponding to this action. The fixed point set of G in the Siegel upper half-space corresponds to a component of the singular locus of the moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties. We also describe an implementation of the algorithm using the open source computer algebra system SAGE.},

  abstract = {The Tevatron has inspired new interest in the subject of magnetic monopoles. First there was the 1998 D0 limit on the virtual production of monopoles, based on the theory of Ginzburg and collaborators. In 2000 and 2004 results from an experiment (Fermilab E882) searching for real magnetically charged particles bound to elements from the CDF and D0 detectors were reported. The strongest direct experimental limits, from the CDF collaboration, have been reported in 2005. Less strong, but complementary, limits from the H1 collaboration at HERA were reported in the same year. Interpretation of these experiments also require new developments in theory. Earlier experimental and observational constraints on point-like (Dirac) and non-Abelian monopoles were given from the 1970s through the 1990s, with occasional short-lived positive evidence for such exotic particles reported. The status of the experimental limits on monopole masses will be reported, as well as the limitation of the theory of magnetic charge at present.},

  abstract = {We apply to the Atiyah-Ward ansätze a systematic procedure locating symmetric monopoles in SU(3) gauge theory broken to U(1) × U(1). In particular we recover the known spherically symmetric monopole as a limit of a cylindrically symmetric separated two monopole solution in SU(3). We also discuss the spherically symmetric monopole in SU(n). This latter is the only instance where we have properly shown the smoothness of the Higgs and gauge fields.},
