abstract = {Using a Yukawa type of metric we derive the Kretschmann scalar (KS) for a general static black hole of mass M. The scalar gives the curvature of the spacetime as a function of the radial distance r in the vicinity as well as inside of the black hole. Furthermore, the Kretschmann scalar helps us understand the black hole's appearance as a "whole entity". It can be applied in solar mass size black holes, neutron stars or supermassive black holes at the center of various galaxies. In an effort to investigate the connection of geometry to entropy and information, the Kretschmann scalar for a solar mass Yukawa Schwarzschild and simple Schwarzschild black holes are derived. Moreover, the curvature's dependence on the entropy and number of information N in nats is derived.},

abstract = {Newton's equations for the motion of N nonrelativistic point particles attracting according to the inverse square law may be cast in the form of equations for null geodesics in a (3N+2)-dimensional Lorentzian spacetime which is Ricci flat and admits a covariantly constant null vector. Such a spacetime admits a Bargmann structure and corresponds physically to a plane-fronted gravitational wave (generalized pp wave). Bargmann electromagnetism in five dimensions actually comprises the two distinct Galilean electromagnetic theories pointed out by Le Bellac and L{\'{e}}vy-Leblond. At the quantum level, the N-body Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation may be cast into the form of a massless wave equation. We exploit the conformal symmetries of such spacetimes to discuss some properties of the Newtonian N-body problem, in particular, (i) homographic solutions, (ii) the virial theorem, (iii) Kepler's third law, (iv) the Lagrange-Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector arising from three conformal Killing two-tensors, and (v) the motion under time-dependent inverse-square-law forces whose strength varies inversely as time in a manner originally envisaged by Dirac in his theory of a time-dependent gravitational constant G(t). It is found that the problem can be reduced to one with time-independent inverse-square-law forces for a rescaled position vector and a new time variable. This transformation (Vinti and Lynden-Bell) is shown to arise from a particular conformal transformation of spacetime which preserves the Ricci-flat condition originally pointed out by Brinkmann. We also point out (vi) a Ricci-flat metric representing a system of N nonrelativistic gravitational dyons. Our results for a general time-dependent G(t) are also applicable by suitable reinterpretation to the motion of point particles in an expanding universe. Finally we extend these results to the quantum regime. {\textcopyright} 1991 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {A fundamental problem in the theory of Hopf algebras is the classification and construction of finite-dimensional quasitriangular Hopf algebras over C. Quasitriangular Hopf algebras constitute a very important class of Hopf algebras, introduced by Drinfeld. They are the Hopf algebras whose representations form a braided tensor category. However, this intriguing problem is extremely hard and is still widely open. Triangular Hopf algebras are the quasitriangular Hopf algebras whose representations form a symmetric tensor category. In that sense they are the closest to group algebras. The structure of triangular Hopf algebras is far from trivial , and yet is more tractable than that of general Hopf algebras, due to their proximity to groups. This makes triangular Hopf algebras an excellent testing ground for general Hopf algebraic ideas, methods and conjectures. A general classification of triangular Hopf algebras is not known yet. However, the problem was solved in the semisimple case, in the minimal triangular pointed case, and more generally for triangular Hopf algebras with the Chevalley property. In this paper we report on all of this, and explain in full details the mathematics and ideas involved in this theory. The classification in the semisimple case relies on Deligne's theorem on Tannakian categories and on Movshev's theory in an essential way. We explain Movshev's theory in details, and refer to [G5] for a detailed discussion of the first aspect. We also discuss the existence of grouplike elements in quasitriangular semisimple Hopf algebras, and the representation theory of cotriangular semisimple Hopf algebras. We conclude the paper with a list of open problems; in particular with the question whether any finite-dimensional triangular Hopf algebra over C has the Chevalley property.},

abstract = {Introducing the reader to classical integrable systems and their applications, this book synthesizes the different approaches to the subject, providing a set of interconnected methods for solving problems in mathematical physics. The authors introduce and explain each method, and demonstrate how it can be applied to particular examples. Rather than presenting an exhaustive list of the various integrable systems, they focus on classical objects which have well-known quantum counterparts, or are the semi-classical limits of quantum objects. They thus enable readers to understand the literature on quantum integrable systems. This book provides a thorough introduction to the theory of classical integrable systems, discussing the various approaches to the subject and explaining their interrelations. The book begins by introducing the central ideas of the theory of integrable systems, based on Lax representations, loop groups and Riemann surfaces. These ideas are then illustrated with detailed studies of model systems. The connection between isomonodromic deformation and integrability is discussed, and integrable field theories are covered in detail. The KP, KdV and Toda hierarchies are explained using the notion of Grassmannian, vertex operators and pseudo-differential operators. A chapter is devoted to the inverse scattering method and three complementary chapters cover the necessary mathematical tools from symplectic geometry, Riemann surfaces and Lie algebras. The book contains many worked examples and is suitable for use as a textbook on graduate courses. It also provides a comprehensive reference for researchers already working in the field.},

abstract = {The study of higher-dimensional black holes is a subject which has recently attracted a vast interest. Perhaps one of the most surprising discoveries is a realization that the properties of higher-dimensional black holes with the spherical horizon topology and described by the Kerr-NUT-(A)dS metrics are very similar to the properties of the well known four-dimensional Kerr metric. This remarkable result stems from the existence of a single object called the principal tensor. In our review we discuss explicit and hidden symmetries of higher-dimensional black holes. We start with the overview of the Liouville theory of completely integrable systems and introduce Killing and Killing-Yano objects representing explicit and hidden symmetries. We demonstrate that the principal tensor can be used as a `seed object' which generates all these symmetries. It determines the form of the black hole geometry, as well as guarantees its remarkable properties, such as special algebraic type of the spacetime, complete integrability of geodesic motion, and separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi, Klein-Gordon, and Dirac equations. The review also contains a discussion of different applications of the developed formalism and its possible generalizations.},

We will first develop the general theory of explicit and hidden symmetries for particles and fields, and relate them to conserved quantities and integrability of physical theories. The most general spacetime allowing the principal conformal Killing-Yano tensor is constructed, and we derive a suitable coordinate basis for this canonical metric. This we identify with the Kerr-NUT-(A)dS metric upon imposing the Einstein field equations, which describes a very general class of spacetimes with black holes with spherical topology of the event horizon. Focus is then turned onto those higher dimensional stationary black holes, which can all be considered special cases of the Kerr-NUT-(A)dS metric. This treatment includes especially the Kerr, Schwarzschild-Tangherlini and Myers-Perry black holes.},

The remaining case includes the situation when the ends facing each other have a power law tail while the two extreme ends of the two kinks have an exponential tail. Further, we show that for a kink with a power law tail at either one end or at both ends, there is no gap between the zero mode and the continuum of the corresponding stability equation. This is in contrast with the kinks with an exponential tail at both ends, in which case there is always a gap between the zero mode and the continuum.},

This is a nonlinear problem, solved using an adiabatic ansatz for the accelerating kinks that leads to a modified, first-order Bogomolny equation. We find the force decays with the fourth power of the kink separation.},

abstract = {Background: An inverse relationship between allergies with glioma risk has been reported in several but not all epidemiological observational studies. We performed an analysis of genetic variants associated with atopy to assess the relationship with glioma risk using Mendelian randomisation (MR), an approach unaffected by biases from temporal variability and reverse causation that might have affected earlier investigations. Methods: Two-sample MR was undertaken using genome-wide association study data. We used single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with atopic dermatitis, asthma and hay fever, IgE levels, and self-reported allergy as instrumental variables. We calculated MR estimates for the odds ratio (OR) for each risk factor with glioma using SNP-glioma estimates from 12,488 cases and 18,169 controls, using inverse-variance weighting (IVW), maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), weighted median estimate (WME) and mode-based estimate (MBE) methods. Violation of MR assumptions due to directional pleiotropy were sought using MR-Egger regression and HEIDI-outlier analysis. Results: Under IVW, MLE, WME and MBE methods, associations between glioma risk with asthma and hay fever, self-reported allergy and IgE levels were non-significant. An inverse relationship between atopic dermatitis and glioma risk was found by IVW (OR 0.96, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 0.93-1.00, P = 0.041) and MLE (OR 0.96, 95{\%} CI 0.94-0.99, P = 0.003), but not by WME (OR 0.96, 95{\%} CI 0.91-1.01, P = 0.114) or MBE (OR 0.97, 95{\%} CI 0.92-1.02, P = 0.194). Conclusions: Our investigation does not provide strong evidence for relationship between atopy and the risk of developing glioma, but findings do not preclude a small effect in relation to atopic dermatitis. Our analysis also serves to illustrate the value of using several MR methods to derive robust conclusions.},

abstract = {Background: Obesity and related factors have been implicated as possible aetiological factors for the development of glioma in epidemiological observation studies. We used genetic markers in a Mendelian randomisation framework to examine whether obesity-related traits influence glioma risk. This methodology reduces bias from confounding and is not affected by reverse causation. Methods: Genetic instruments were identified for 10 key obesity-related risk factors, and their association with glioma risk was evaluated using data from a genome-wide association study of 12,488 glioma patients and 18,169 controls. The estimated odds ratio of glioma associated with each of the genetically defined obesity-related traits was used to infer evidence for a causal relationship. Results: No convincing association with glioma risk was seen for genetic instruments for body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, lipids, type-2 diabetes, hyperglycaemia or insulin resistance. Similarly, we found no evidence to support a relationship between obesity-related traits with subtypes of glioma-glioblastoma (GBM) or non-GBM tumours. Conclusions: This study provides no evidence to implicate obesity-related factors as causes of glioma.},

abstract = {Little is known about the causes of meningioma. Obesity and obesity-related traits have been reported in several epidemiological observational studies to be risk factors for meningioma. We performed an analysis of genetic variants associated with obesity-related traits to assess the relationship with meningioma risk using Mendelian randomization (MR), an approach unaffected by biases from temporal variability and reverse causation that might have affected earlier investigations. We considered 11 obesity-related traits, identified genetic instruments for these factors, and assessed their association with meningioma risk using data from a genome-wide association study comprising 1,606 meningioma patients and 9,823 controls. To evaluate the causal relationship between the obesity-related traits and meningioma risk, we consider the estimated odds ratio (OR) of meningioma for each genetic instrument. We identified positive associations between body mass index (odds ratio [OR SD ] = 1.27, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 1.03–1.56, P = 0.028) and body fat percentage (OR SD = 1.28, 95{\%} CI = 1.01–1.63, P = 0.042) with meningioma risk, albeit non-significant after correction for multiple testing. Associations for basal metabolic rate, diastolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, triglycerides and waist circumference with risk of meningioma were non-significant. Our analysis provides additional support for obesity being associated with an increased risk of meningioma.},
